Revision history for Coro-PrioChannel

{{$NEXT}}
        ! Some testers don't have sub-second timers (?), such as
          perl 5.17.{[789],10}, or darwin (?), causing a failure in
          t/06_reprio.t.  Workaround in the test, not the code.
          If you are missing sub-second timers, this is likely your
          perl, not this module nor AnyEvent.

        + Add Coro::PrioChannel::Multi
        + Queues now age items to prevent starvation

0.003     2012-04-13
        + Add optional minimum-priority-level to size. Need to figure it out
          for get, too (blocking here is harder, as will be testing).

0.002     2012-04-11
        + Add github metadata
        + Add some better documentation for put (hey, it's all relative)
        + Add test for size method

0.001     2012-04-10
        + Initial revision based nearly completely on Coro::Channel.
